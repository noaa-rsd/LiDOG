    "NOAA": "Data were processed to an initial LAS format using the Riegl RiProcess software. The Applanix POSPac software was utilized for GPS and inertial processing, and GeoCue, Terrasolid, and LP360 software for data visualization, 3D editing, and export to final LAS file. Data were processed in NAD83 horizontal and vertical datum. VDatum was used to process to the MLLW datum. Uncertainties in the vertical datum transformations equate to 8.96 centimeters. QT Modeler was utilized to create the initial 1 meter DEM from an LAS 1.2 format file utilizing ground (2), bathymetric point (26), submerged object (29), and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-57 object (30) classification fields for input. The values in the DEM were not rounded (no rounding rule was applied). Horizontal Datum-NAD83 (2011) epoch: 2010 Projection-UTM Zone 20N Horizontal Units-meters Vertical Datum- MLLW Vertical Units-meters",
