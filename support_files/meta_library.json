    "NOAA": "Data were processed to an initial LAS format using the Riegl RiProcess software. The Applanix POSPac software was utilized for GPS and inertial processing, and GeoCue, Terrasolid, and LP360 software for data visualization, 3D editing, and export to final LAS file. Data were processed in NAD83 horizontal and vertical datum. VDatum was used to process to the MLLW datum. Uncertainties in the vertical datum transformations equate to 8.96 centimeters. QT Modeler was utilized to create the initial 1 meter DEM from an LAS 1.2 format file utilizing ground (2), bathymetric point (26), submerged object (29), and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-57 object (30) classification fields for input. The values in the DEM were not rounded (no rounding rule was applied). Horizontal Datum-NAD83 (2011) epoch: 2010 Projection-UTM Zone 20N Horizontal Units-meters Vertical Datum- MLLW Vertical Units-meters",
    "USACE": "This U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP) dataset was obtained from Digital Coast. This dataset contain rasterized bare earth topobathy lidar elevation data at a 1 meter grid spacing, generated from data collected by the Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging Lidar (CZMIL) system. CZMIL integrates a lidar sensor with simultaneous topographic and bathymetric capabilities, a digital camera and a hyperspectral imager on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. The 3-D position data are used to generate a series of gridded file products, which are tiled into quarter-quads or 5km boxes. DEMs were created from las points (1, 2, 29) at a 1 meter grid size. This data set is a raster file with 5351 columns and 10295 rows and may have been mosaicked, reprojected, and clipped from the original tiles. The dataset was generated from a larger data set and includes all valid data within the requested geographic bounds.",
    "Combined NOAA/USACE": "Data were processed to an initial LAS format using the Riegl RiProcess software. The Applanix POSPac software was utilized for GPS and inertial processing, and GeoCue, Terrasolid, and LP360 software for data visualization, 3D editing, and export to final LAS file. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) National  Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP)was obtained from Digital Coast in a LAS format.  NOAA and USACE data was blended.  Data were processed in NAD83 horizontal and vertical datum. VDatum was used to process to the MLLW datum.  Uncertainties in the vertical datum transformations equate to 11.6 centimeters.  QT Modeler was utilized to create the initial 1 meter DEM from an LAS 1.2 format file utilizing ground (2), bathymetric point  (26),  submerged object (29), and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-57 object (30) classification fields for input.
